# newsrack

A PWA RSS reader with offline reading.

Intended to replace feedary. 

Add news feeds and aggregate the articles. New articles will be cached for offline reading, ideally. 

Mercury-Parser can extract content from a web page for better read. it's not perfect though. 

Using GunDB for peer to peer data sync. 

Svelte for the front end. 

What for user accounts?

Does the server keep a list of a user's gundb peers?
